For singer/songwriters Jamie Kent, Matthew Szlachetka, Jeff Campbell and Megan Slankard, networking with each other and working their business relationships became the key to furthering their touring career. The performers all met several years ago through their relationship using the Bose L1 system and have been collaborating on shows, songs, and recordings ever since. Eventually, a tour and collaboration was the natural next step. Each show is set up in a "writers round" style, with each artist taking turns sharing a song/story, and the others all supporting with their respective instruments and voices.

"A one-of-a-kind spectacular songwriter event where each artist let his or her individual style radiate from the stage during the unique and engaging concert experience."

Matthew, Jamie, Megan, and Jeff are already dynamic individuals in their own right, but when united on stage in a free-flowing smorgasbord of music, laughter, and banter, the energy of the room crackled with a compelling warmth and camaraderie. The crowd was held spellbound through the entire evening as the four troubadours plied their trade
